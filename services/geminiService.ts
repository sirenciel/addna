        Then, for each selected trigger, explain it clearly and provide a concrete example of how it applies directly to this product, persona, angle, and awareness stage.

        **Predefined List of Psychological Triggers:**
        - **Social Proof:** People trust what others are doing. (e.g., "Join 10,000+ happy customers").
        - **Authority:** People trust experts and credible sources. (e.g., "Recommended by top dermatologists").
        - **Scarcity:** People want what is rare or limited. (e.g., "Only 50 left in stock!").
        - **Urgency:** People act when there's a time limit. (e.g., "Sale ends tonight!").
        - **Reciprocity:** People feel obligated to give back after receiving something. (e.g., "Get a free guide & see how it works").
        - **Liking:** People buy from those they know, like, and trust. (e.g., using a relatable influencer).
        - **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** People don't want to be left out of a positive experience. (e.g., "See what everyone is talking about").
        - **Exclusivity:** People want to be part of a select group. (e.g., "Get access to our private community").
        - **Instant Gratification:** People want results now. (e.g., "See visible results in just 3 days").

        **Context:**
        - **Product:** ${blueprint.productAnalysis.name}
        - **Key Benefit:** ${blueprint.productAnalysis.keyBenefit}
        - **Target Persona:** ${persona.description} (Pain Points: ${persona.painPoints.join(', ')})
        - **Strategic Angle:** "${angle}"
        - **Awareness Stage:** "${awarenessStage}"
        - **Target Country for Localization:** "${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}"

        **Instructions:**
        1.  Analyze the context and choose the 4 best triggers from the list. For "Unaware" or "Problem Aware" stages, triggers like Reciprocity or Liking are better. For "Solution Aware" or "Product Aware", triggers like Scarcity or Social Proof are more effective.
        2.  For each chosen trigger, create a JSON object with three fields: "name", "description", and "example".
        3.  **name:** The exact name of the trigger from the list.
        4.  **description:** A simple, one-sentence explanation of the psychological principle.
        5.  **example:** A specific, actionable example of how to apply this trigger in an ad for *this* product, persona, angle, and awareness stage. The example should be a snippet of ad copy or a visual idea that resonates in "${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}".

        - trigger: Must be "${trigger}".

        - personaCreatorType: Must be "${persona.creatorType}".
        - visualVehicle: A brief description of the visual format (e.g., "Authentic-looking vertical user video").
        - hook: A compelling opening line for the ad copy. The hook and visual must work together. **First, imagine a 'Visual Hook'â€”a single, scroll-stopping image. Then, write this 'Text Hook' to directly complement or create curiosity about that image.** The hook must embody the psychological essence of the "${trigger}", address a persona pain point, and be **localized for ${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}.**
        - headline: A powerful headline for the ad. It must reinforce the "${trigger}" and clearly communicate the **Key Benefit ("${blueprint.productAnalysis.keyBenefit}")** and the **Offer ("${blueprint.adDna.offerSummary}")** in a way that is natural for the **"${awarenessStage}" Awareness Stage**.
            - For "Product Aware" or "Solution Aware" audiences, the headline should be direct about the offer (e.g., "Dapatkan Diskon 50% Hari Ini!").
            - For "Unaware" or "Problem Aware" audiences, the offer should be more subtle or framed as a discovery (e.g., "Rahasia Kulit Glowing Akhirnya Terungkap...").
            - The headline must be localized for ${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}.
        - visualPrompt: A detailed, specific prompt for an AI image generator.
            - **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISUAL PROMPT**:
            - 1. **Describe the 'Visual Hook'**: The prompt MUST be a detailed description of the 'Visual Hook' you imagined when writing the \`hook\`. What is happening in that scroll-stopping moment? The text and visual MUST be strongly connected.
            - 2. **Embody The Trigger**: The visual scene MUST be a metaphor for or a direct representation of the psychological trigger: "${trigger}". The entire scene's mood, composition, and action should convey this trigger.
            - 3. **Persona-Driven Scene**: The core concept, setting, subject, and overall vibe MUST be authentic to the persona's Age ("${persona.age}") and Creator Type ("${persona.creatorType}"). The scene must feel genuine to them and be culturally appropriate for **${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}**.
            ${visualStyleInstruction}
            - 5. **Action and Emotion**: The person in the scene should be interacting with the product or embodying the feeling the product provides. Describe their expression and body language.
        - adSetName: A suggested ad set name in the format: Persona_Angle_Trigger_Awareness_Format_Placement_v1.
        
        *** IMPORTANT FOR CAROUSEL PLACEMENT ***
        If placement is "Carousel", include a "carouselSlides" field: an array of 3-5 slide objects, each with "slideNumber", "visualPrompt", "headline", and "description". The final slide should strongly feature the CTA and embody the trigger. All text must be localized for **${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}**.

        - awarenessStage: Must be "${baseConcept.awarenessStage}".
        - strategicPathId: Must be "${baseConcept.strategicPathId}".
        - personaDescription: Must be "${baseConcept.personaDescription}".
        - personaAge: Must be "${baseConcept.personaAge}".
        - personaCreatorType: Must be "${baseConcept.personaCreatorType}".
        - visualVehicle: A brief description of the new visual format.
        - hook: A compelling new opening line for the ad copy, adapted for the evolution mandate and localized for ${blueprint.adDna.targetCountry}.

        - visualPrompt: A new, detailed, specific prompt for an AI image generator.
